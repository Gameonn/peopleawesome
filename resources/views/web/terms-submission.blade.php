			 </p>

			<h4>Licensed Rights </h4>
			<p> 
			Licensor grants Check This Out the unlimited, exclusive right to change, use, refrain from using, modify, edit, subtract from, add to and rearrange the Submissions and to distribute, broadcast, reproduce, license others to reproduce and publish, distribute, promote, advertise and otherwise exploit the Submissions by any methods, whether now realised or later devised, in any fashion and in any form of media in perpetuity throughout the world, for any purpose as Check This Out in its sole discretion may determine (the “Licensed Rights”), including for the purpose of promotional, advertising and marketing activities. The Licensor does also irrevocably appoint Check This Out as its attorney-in-fact to take any action as may be required to transfer, effect or assign the rights granted to Check This Out herein, including without any limitations a copyright-related action, and assigns to Check This Out the right to prosecute any claims from the present, past and future use of the Submissions by unauthorized parties.
			</p>

			<h4>Licensor Warranties and Representations</h4>
			<p>
				Owner of the Rights: Licensor has the exclusive, sole and unencumbered ownership of all rights worldwide and also to the Licensed Rights. They have full title to the works upon which the Submissions are based. The Licensor has the absolute right to grant Check This Out all licenses, rights and privileges vested in or granted to Check This Out under these Terms. The Licensor will not authorize and has not authorized any third party to take any action or exercise any right that impairs the rights granted herein to Check This Out. <br>
				Rights Are Clear: Licensor has all required clearances and paid any fees required for Check This Out to exercise its exclusive rights and there are no further rights to be cleared or payments to be made by Check This Out as a result of the use of the Submissions pursuant to the licenses and rights granted herein (including without limits payments in connection with contingent residuals, participations, moral rights, clearance rights, music rights and union fees). Licensor has not entered into any previous agreement in relation to the Submissions. All of the entities and individuals involved with the production of the Submissions, and all of the entities and individuals whose voices, names, photographs, works,  likenesses, services and other material appear or have been used in the Submission, have approved Licensor’s use thereof, and Check This Out shall have the right to use all names, photographs, voices, appearances, likenesses and performances contained in the Submissions in relation to the promotion, exploitation and use of the Licensed Rights. It is understood that Check This Out has not taken on any obligations under any contracts the Licensor has entered into.<br>
				No Infringement: No part of the Submissions, any material contained within, or the exercise by Check This Out of the Licensed Rights will infringe or infringes, will violate or violates any trade name, contract, trademark, copyright (whether statutory or common law), agreement, patent, artistic, literary, music, personal,  dramatic, private, property, civil, privacy or publicity right, moral right of authors or any other right of any entity or person, and will not give rise to a claim of libel or slander. There are no anticipated, existing or threatened litigation or claims that would impair or adversely affect any of the Licensed Rights.
			</p>

			<h4>Consideration </h4>
			<p>
				In full consideration to Licensor for all Licensed Rights granted to Check This Out herein, Check This Out will consider Submissions for inclusion in original productions and compilations.
			</p>

			<h4>Indemnity and Release</h4>
			<p>
				Licensor hereby agrees to release, indemnify and hold harmless Check This Out, its licensees, successors, sub-distributors and assigns, and the directors, employees, officers, representatives and agents of each of the above, from any claims, causes of action, demands, damages, liabilities, judgments, costs, losses, expenses and attorney’s fees resulting from (i) Breach by Licensor of any representation, warranty or any provision of these Terms, and/or (ii) claims respecting defamation, slander, false light, libel, invasion of privacy or right of publicity, infringement of copyright, infringement of trademark or violations of any rights resulting from or relating to any use by Check This Out of the rights granted under these Terms. The Licensor agrees that Check This Out is relying on the representations made by Licensor in relation with these Terms and a breach made by the Licensor would cause Check This Out irrevocable damage and injury that cannot be adequately compensated by damages in an action of law and the Licensor therefore agrees expressly that, without limiting the remedies of Check This Out, that Check This Out will be entitled to injunctive and/or equitable relief.
			</p>

			<h4>Termination</h4>
			<p>
				At any time the Licensor may seek to terminate its agreement to these Terms. However, these Terms will only be terminated upon the mutual agreement of the parties, the consent of such may be denied or granted in Check This Out’s sole discretion. No termination shall affect any prior license of the Submission by Check This Out prior to termination, which will continue in full effect under these Terms.
			</p>

			<h4>Confidentiality/Publicity </h4>
			<p>
				Licensor shall not disseminate, release, authorize or issue or cause the dissemination, release, or issue of any information or publicity concerning the Licensed Rights or these Terms without Check This Out’s prior written consent (including, without limitation, posting, participating or in social media discussions, blogs, news stories, reports or responses to the above), and Licensor will direct all licensing or further inquiries relating to the Submission solely to Check This Out. The Licensor does acknowledge that these Terms are confidential and agrees not to disclose the content or substance to any third parties other than: (i) Licensor’s accountants or attorneys, and/or (ii) as may be required reasonably in order to comply with obligations imposed by these Terms, or any statute, regulation, ordinance, law, rule or court order.
			</p>

			<h4>Choice of Law/Dispute Resolution</h4>
			<p>
			These Terms are deemed to have been agreed upon within the Canton of Zürich, Swiss Confederation, and the obligations and rights and of the relevant parties shall be enforced and construed in accordance with, and governed by, the laws of the Canton of Zürich, Swiss Confederation, without regard to the conflicts of law principles thereof. The parties thereby agree to the personal jurisdiction by and venue in Canton of Zürich, Swiss Confederation, and also waive any objection to such a jurisdiction or venue irrespective of whether the party resides in the Canton. Except for Check This Out’s equitable rights as dictated in these terms, the parties agree to submit any disputes arising from or in connection with these terms or the parties’ obligations in connection therewith to binding arbitration within the Canton of Zürich, Swiss Confederation in accordance with the relevant laws and only for actual monetary damages, if there are any. If there is a dispute, the Licensor will not be entitled to, and does waive all right to, any equitable relief, including the right to revoke its agreement to these Terms, to revoke any rights granted within, or to restrain, enjoin or interfere in any manner with the distribution, advertisement, marketing or exploitation of the Licensed Rights. All rights to recover incidental, consequential and/or punitive damages are also waived by Licensor.
			</p>

			<h4>Miscellaneous </h4>
			<p>
				The Licensor acknowledges that its agreement to these Terms has not been induced by any assurance or representation not contained herein. These Terms replace and supersede any prior negotiations, agreements or understandings in relation with the Licensed Rights, including any simplified explanation of the terms, and if there are any inconsistencies between this English-language document and any such translations of the terms of submission, the English-language document will prevail. These Terms contain the full understanding of the relevant parties and cannot be modified except via a document in written form executed by both parties. If any such provision of these Terms is deemed to be unenforceable or unlawful, such provision shall be limited only to the necessary extent, with all other provisions of the Terms remaining in active effect. The consent to a breach of any of the provisions of these Terms by the other party or waiver by either party will not operate or be construed as a waiver of, excuse of or consent to, any other breach by the other party. Check This Out has the right to freely assign the Submissions, the Licensed Rights and/or any of Check This Out’s other specified rights hereunder to any entity or person (by operation of law or otherwise). The Licensor may not assign its rights specified hereunder.
